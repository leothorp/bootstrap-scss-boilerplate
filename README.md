A basic starting point for laying out a page with Bootstrap's SCSS.

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. The page is served at localhost:3000. SCSS files are recompiled when saved (but adding a new file may require restarting.)
To override the defaults for Bootstrap SCSS variables, edit _custom.scss (making sure to remove the `!default` from the variable definition.)
